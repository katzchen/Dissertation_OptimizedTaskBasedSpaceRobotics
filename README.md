# Dissertation_OptimizedTaskBasedSpaceRobotics
Code for dissertation by Katherine McBryan. I make no promises that this code is understandable, clear, concise, or easily managed. That being said, It was developed using MatLab 2017a. It makes use of the optimization toolbox, and the parallel computing one. In addition it also uses Peter Corke's robotics toolbox. Cheers.
